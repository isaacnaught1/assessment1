const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = " The second step is to determine what the app or webpage is going to be able to need to do to in order to fulfil its purpose"
const design = "Picking a theme or structure to ensure that the people who use you product are going to enjoy and trust using it."
const implementation = "This is the step where the actual coding and building of the product takes place."
const testingAndIntegration ="In this step the code is run and any major bugs are removed to make sure that the product is functional and will not be hated initially for having so many problems"
const maintain = "after the product goes on the market you watch it to be able to fix any  bugs or problems that arise in a swift and efficient manner."
